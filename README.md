## 📚 Overview

Computer Science is divided into **4 parts**:

- **[Computer Science 1](#computer-science---1)** – Hardware & Engineering  
- **[Computer Science 2](#computer-science---2)** – Programming & Core CS  
- **[Computer Science 3](#computer-science---3)** – Daily / Systems CS  
- **[Computer Science 4](#computer-science---4)** – Real-World Applications  

📘 **[Discrete Mathematics](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~arlal/book/mth202.pdf)** <sup>PDF</sup> is required for understanding graphs  
📐 **[Mathematics Syllabus](https://github.com/apeman/awesome_computer_science/blob/master/Mathematics.md)**  
☁️ Cloud computing basics are covered under **Computer Networks**
